## Tool-friendly Scala code. What? Why?
People complain a lot about Scala tooling. People complains a lot about weather. But is Scala tooling as weather? So I cannot do anything with it except from move to different climate (language). Lucky no.

Scala tooling usually have only JVM stack to work with and it was created for Java (especially metadata handling that is vital for tools).
Tool-friednly code for me is Scala code that make tools live easier.

I do not want convince anyone to write java-like code. I just want to to point some small details that make your code much more tool-friendly.
In next blog posts I will show some codestyle ideas that makes your code easier to debug, profile and surprisingly understand.

Stay tuned!
