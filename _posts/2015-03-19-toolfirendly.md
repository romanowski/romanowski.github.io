## Tool-friendly Scala code. What? Why?
People complain a lot about Scala tooling. People complain a lot about weather. But is Scala tooling like weather? Something You cannot do anything about, except from moving to different climate (language)? Luckily no.

Scala tooling usually have only JVM stack to work with and it was created for Java (especially metadata handling that is vital for tools).
Tool-friendly code for me is a Scala code that make tools live easier.

I do not want to convince anyone to write java-like code. I just want to to point out some small details that can make Your code much more tool-friendly.
In the next blog posts I will show a few codestyle ideas that will make Your code easier to debug, profile and - surprisingly - understand.

Stay tuned!
